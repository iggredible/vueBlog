description: What I learned from reading over 120 books last year

I read that Bill Gates read about [50 books a year](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-bill-gates-reads-50-books-a-year-2015-11). If one of the busiest men on earth can read 50 books, I can do it too! So I set a target in 2019 to read at least 50 books.

I finished 2019 having read 123 books. For a list of books I read, you can find them on goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8348083-iggy).

Here are 5 things I did to help me meet that goal. If you are not a reader but want to become one, believe me, by forming the right habits, anyone can do this. My hope is to encourage you that you can read more than 50 books each year even if you live a busy life.

# Impose a daily reading limit.

First, you need to set yourself a minimum amount of daily reading time that you absolutely cannot break. I decided that I would not go to sleep at night until I have read a book for 25 minutes per day. However, the number itself is arbitrary. I picked 25 because that's the standard time for [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Set a number that you are comfortable with. I suggest starting out with smaller number that you can follow consistently than starting too high and fail to keep up.

The important thing is, that limit must be followed daily no matter what. Ask your spouse, friend, or even a daily reminder on your phone to help you. Do not let a single day pass without you completing it. It does not have to be in one big continuous chunk either. You can do 5 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes at lunch, and 10 minutes before bed. I personally did 15 minutes after dinner and 10 minutes before bed.

Also, do not let the minutes to roll over. 25 minutes. Every. Day. If I read 3 hours one day, this does not mean I am excused for the rest of the week. I have to do another 25 minutes the next day.

I admit the first 2 months was rough. I was struggling to meet daily quota. I remember one day I came home at 11 PM after a long day. After my wife slept, I sat inside the closet and read. You must push through it and do it. This is how habits are formed. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes much easier.

If you read at average rate of 1 page/ minute, 25 min/ year = 9125 pages. Assuming average books have 200-300 pages, That's at least 30-40 books/ year! Note that 25 is the minimum; I would end up reading for more than 25 minutes most days.

# Have books in your phone

[Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) is my favorite app to do this. It is a book subsription app for only $8.99/ month! It's like netflix for books. Not only books, it also has a good selection of articles, podcasts, and audiobooks.

I also have kindle in my phone and tablet. There are some books that are available only on Kindle and not on Scribd. I heard [overdrive](https://app.overdrive.com/) and [audible](https://www.audible.com/) are also good ones to have. About 75% of my reading last year was done on my phone/ tablet.

Whenever I am waiting in line, waiting in car, waiting anywhere, I would pull out my phone and read. A minute here and there throughout the day adds up!

A good trick is, whenever you find yourself waiting for prolonged time, instead of browsing instagram/ tiktok/ facebook/ snapchat, force yourself to read a book for 5 minutes, then reward yourself by going to your favorite social media app after.

# Listen to audiobooks when you travelling

I made a habit listening to audiobooks on my way to work. Thanks to Scribd, I always have access of audiobooks on my phone. It takes 20-30 minutes to commute to work. I set a minimum of 10 minutes listening to audiobooks. For my reward, I would listen to my favorite music.

This ensures that I listen to minimum of 20 minutes audiobooks every weekdays. On average, in a week, I listened to 100-150 minutes of audiobooks. This amounts to a third or even a whole book a week. I finished around 2 audiobooks each month (which is about 24 books per year, almost half of the reading quota!)

#  Visit local libraries

I live relatively near local library. If you live in a major city, chances are you probably have one nearby. I try to make an effort with my wife to visit it (plus our friend works there) at least once or twice a month. While we are there, we would stay for 1-2 hours. This forces me to read a good amount each visit. After visiting a library, you can reward yourself - go visit your favorite store afterwards!

Although I read most of my books in digital format, nothing beats the feeling of physical book. Plus being a library book, I have to return it within 3 weeks. This forces me to finish a book within 3 weeks.

# Reading before entertainment

Before me and my wife would watch shows or play games, we would spend some time reading for 15 minutes. Even 10 minutes goes a long way.

This goes with everthing else entertainment. Before we go to movies, exploring town, go to restaurant, have people over, etc, I would read something before. This makes entertainment even more rewarding.

Just like water tastes better after a good physical workout, entertainment feels better after a good mental workout.

# Conclusion

In [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055PGUYU/), Duhigg said that to make something into a habit, you need to have 3 things: a cue, a routine, and a reward. To make reading a book into a habit, you need those 3 as well. If you notice, there is always a reward after reading. My goal is to help you develop reading as a habit. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes easier to read everyday.

One of my cues is dinner: after dinner, I would try to read (routine) for about 15 minuts. For the reward, we would watch a show/ play PS4/ board games afterwards. Once this became a habit, it got a lot easier.

By reading 50 books/ year, in 10 years I would have read 500 books. In 40 years, it is over 2000 books. If however I read 100 books each year, in 10 years it becomes 1000 books, 40 years = 4000 books. I don't think I will ever go back and say, man, I wish I would hav read less books and watched more shows!

So there you have it folks. Thanks for making it this far. These are some things I did to read 120 books last year. This year, I plan to set the same goal (50 books). I just finished [Five cities that ruled the world](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007FZSTI8/) book and [Primal Branding](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FCKRWY/) audiobook. I just picked up [ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) for my next reading. Maybe I will write about books I read soon.
