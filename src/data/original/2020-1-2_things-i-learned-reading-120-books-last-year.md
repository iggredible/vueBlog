I read that Bill Gates read about [50 books a year](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-bill-gates-reads-50-books-a-year-2015-11). If one of the busiest men on earth can read 50 books, why can't we? I set a target in 2019 to read at least 50 books.

I finished 2019 having read 123 books using techniques I mention below (For a list of books I read, you can find them on goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8348083-iggy)).

Here are 4 things I did to help me meet that goal. If you are not a reader but want start reading more, by forming the right habits, anyone can do this. My hope is to encourage you that you can read more than 50 books each year even if you are very busy.

# Impose a daily reading limit.

First, you need to set yourself a minimum amount of daily reading time that you absolutely cannot break. I decided that I would not go to sleep at night until I have read a book for 25 minutes per day. However, the number 25 itself is arbitrary. I picked 25 because that's the standard time for [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Set a number that you can keep up with. I suggest starting out with smaller number that you can follow consistently than starting too high and fail to keep up.

The important thing is, that limit must be followed daily no matter what. Ask your spouse, friend, or even a daily reminder to help you. Do not let a single day pass without you completing it. It does not have to be in one big continuous chunk either. You can do 5 minutes in the morning, 10 minutes at lunch, and 10 minutes before bed.

Also, the minutes do not to roll over.

25 minutes.

Every.

Day.

If I read 3 hours one day, this does not mean I am excused for the rest of the week. I have to do another 25 minutes the next day.

I admit the first 2 months were rough. I was struggling to meet daily quota. I remember one day I came home at 11 PM after a long day. After my wife slept, I sat inside the closet and read. You must push through it and do it. This is how habits are formed. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes much easier.

If you read at average rate of 1 page/ minute, 25 min/ year = 9125 pages. Assuming average books have 200-300 pages, That's at least 30-40 books/ year! From my experience, I usually end up reading for more than 25 minutes most days.

# Have books in your phone

[Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/) is my best friend. It is a book subscription app for only $8.99/ month! It's like Netflix for books. Not only books, it also has a good selection of articles, podcasts, and audiobooks.

I also have kindle in my phone and tablet. There are some books that are available only on Kindle and not on Scribd. I heard [Overdrive](https://app.overdrive.com/) and [Audible](https://www.audible.com/) are also good ones to have. Find whatever works for you. About 75% of my reading last year was done on my phone/ tablet.

Whenever I waited in line, waiting in car, waiting in bathroom ðŸ˜…, I would pull out my phone and read. A minute here and there throughout the day adds up!

A good trick is, whenever you find yourself waiting for prolonged time, instead of browsing Instagram/ TikTok/ Facebook/ Snapchat, force yourself to read a book for 5 minutes, *then* reward yourself by going to your favorite social media app after.

# Listen to audiobooks when you traveling

I made a habit listening to audiobooks on my way to work. Thanks to Scribd, I always have access of audiobooks on my phone. It takes 20-30 minutes commuting to work. I set a minimum of 10 minutes listening to audiobooks. **As a reward*, I can listen to my favorite music.

This ensured that I listen to minimum of 20 minutes audiobooks every weekdays. On average, in a week, I listened to 100-150 minutes of audiobooks. This amounted to a third or even a whole book a week. I finished around 2 audiobooks each month (which is about 24 books per year, almost half of the reading quota!).

# Reading before entertainment

Before me and my wife watch shows or play games, we spend time reading for 15 minutes. Even 10 minutes goes a long way.

This goes with everything else entertainment. Before we go to movies, exploring town, go to restaurant, have people over, etc, I would read for 10-30 minutes. This makes entertainment even more rewarding.

Just like water tastes better after a good physical workout, entertainment feels better after a good mental workout.

# Conclusion

In [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0055PGUYU/), Duhigg said that to make something into a habit, you need to have 3 things: a cue, a routine, and a reward. To form a reading habit, you need to find your own cue, routine, and reward. If you notice, there is always a reward after my reading time: listening to my favorite songs, going to movie, indulging in social media, etc. Once it becomes a habit, it becomes easier to read everyday.

If you read 50 books/ year, in 10 years you will read 500 books. If you read 100 books each year (sounds daunting but doable), in 10 years you will read 1000 books, 40 years = 4000 books! I don't think I will ever go back and say, "Man, I wish I would have read less books and watched more [Disney+](https://www.disneyplus.com/)!".

So there you have it folks. Thanks for making it this far. These are some things I did to read 120 books last year. I am setting the same goal this year (50 books). Maybe I will start writing book reviews of some of the top books I read. What do you think?

Anyway, what will you read this week?
