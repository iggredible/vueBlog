# dev.to Blog

We all agree that [dev.to](https://dev.to/) is the best dev spot in the world. What if you want to cross posts your articles into your own personal vue site but too lazy to copy-paste them each time?

Now you can fetch all your dev.to posts and put them in your personal blog.

This app uses [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) to store your DEV_KEY info. Create a `.env` file in project root and add `DEV_KEY=YOUR_DEV_KEY_HERE`

You can find your `DEV_KEY` inside Settings -> Account
